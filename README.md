### :newspaper: Js learning foundations (practice) 

If you are just starting to learn JavaScript, here are some topics that you might want to consider learning:

Basics of the JavaScript language: This includes concepts such as variables, data types, operators, loops, and control structures.
DOM manipulation: JavaScript can be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage, which represents the structure of the webpage in the form of objects. You can use JavaScript to modify the DOM, adding, removing, or updating elements on the webpage.
Working with events: JavaScript can be used to respond to events on a webpage, such as a user clicking a button or hovering over an element. You can use JavaScript to specify what actions should be taken in response to these events.
Asynchronous programming: JavaScript is single-threaded, which means that it can only execute one task at a time. However, it is possible to use asynchronous programming techniques in JavaScript to perform tasks in the background without blocking the main execution thread.
Working with APIs: JavaScript can be used to make HTTP requests to retrieve data from external APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This can be used to access data from other websites or services, or to build integrations with other platforms.
Introduction to modern JavaScript frameworks: There are many popular JavaScript frameworks that can be used to build web applications, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js. If you are interested in building web applications, you might want to consider learning one of these frameworks.
These are just a few examples of the topics that you might want to consider learning as you start to learn JavaScript. There are many other topics that you can explore as well, depending on your interests and goals.
